# Credit-Risk-Analysis
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two bank datasets, "current application" and "previous application," to gain insights into credit risk factors in lending. The objective of this project is to analyze the data and identify key factors that contribute to credit risk using advanced statistical methods and visualizations.

# Introduction
Credit risk analysis is an essential component of lending decisions in the banking industry. Understanding the factors that contribute to credit risk is crucial for managing loan portfolios and ensuring the financial health of lending institutions. The purpose of this project is to explore two bank datasets and identify key credit risk factors.

# Datasets
The two datasets used in this project are:

"Current Application" dataset: Contains information about customers' loan applications, including credit scores, income, loan amount, and whether the loan was approved or not.

"Previous Application" dataset: Contains information about customers' previous loan applications, including the loan amount, loan type, and status.

# Installation
To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
# Results
The analysis revealed several key factors that contribute to credit risk in lending, including low credit score, high debt-to-income ratio, and low income. The project also identified interesting trends in the data, such as the relationship between loan purpose and credit risk.
# Conclusion
This project provides an overview of credit risk analysis using advanced statistical methods and visualizations. By identifying key credit risk factors, the project helps lending institutions make better-informed lending decisions and manage their loan portfolios effectively.
